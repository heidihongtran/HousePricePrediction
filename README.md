# House Price Prediction
This is a group work in my post-graduate program.

About the data: The HousingDataSet.csv file contains data on sales used. It has 21,613 records containing details on 21 attributes. The goal is to predict the price of a house based on its specifications.

Project Requirements:

  1. Use multiple linear regression to predict the prices of the two houses in the file using the 4 to 6-house specifications selected requirement number 2.
  
  2. Use Python to build KNN classification models using K = 5 and K=10. Determine which K gives a better prediction accuracy and use it to predict the prices of the two houses in the cleaned data set file.
  
  3. Compare the prediction performance of multiple linear regression achieved in requirement 1 and the KNN classifier achieved in requirement 2.
